Community support
=================

If you run into problems using HandBrake, first take a look at this documentation's [Table of contents](../table-of-contents.html)â€”the information you need may be just a click away.

Didn't find it? Keep reading.

## Activity Logs

Activity logs explain a lot and are **required** for all support requests. More information about [Activity Logs](../help/activity-log.html).

If you think you have a simple question for which an activity log is not **required**, please read [Why are Activity Logs required for support?](../help/why-activity-log.html).

## Community Forums

The [HandBrake Community Forums](https://forum.handbrake.fr/) are available 24/7. Whether you have a support request or simply want to connect with other HandBrake users, this is the place. Registration is free. Please read and abide by our [Community Rules](https://forum.handbrake.fr/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=6702).

If you need help or have encountered an error while using HandBrake, first take a look at our [Support Forums](https://forum.handbrake.fr/viewforum.php?f=16) or [Search](https://forum.handbrake.fr/search.php) using some words related to your questions. Doing this saves everyone from repeating answers to common questions. If you still haven't found an answer, feel free to start a new support request. Make sure to read [How To Request Support](https://forum.handbrake.fr/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=31236) before posting.

Developers and keen users may report reproducible bugs on the [Bugs Forum](https://forum.handbrake.fr/viewforum.php?f=12). Please read the [bug reporting readme](https://forum.handbrake.fr/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=18906) before posting.

## IRC discussion channels

Real-time chat is available on our [Freenode](http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml) IRC channel, [#handbrake](irc://irc.freenode.net/#handbrake). Make sure to provide an [Activity Log]../activity-log.html) when requesting support.

Note that HandBrake's developers are located in various timezones around the world, and have lives and jobs outside of HandBrake and its community. It's possible that nobody will be able to answer your support request on IRC right away. Be patient for awhile or ask on the forums.

Developer discussion happens on [#handbrake-dev](irc://irc.freenode.net/#handbrake-dev), which is moderated for the team's sanity. If you've a developer and would like to speak on [#handbrake-dev](irc://irc.freenode.net/#handbrake-dev), you may ask politely on [#handbrake](irc://irc.freenode.net/#handbrake).
